## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

A repository with implementations of some classic machine learning models from scratch using numpy.

<details open>
<summary>Additional info</summary>
<br>

 If you want to truly understand the algorithm that you are using, itâ€™s good to implement it from scratch. The implementation of models implies an understanding of their operation, possible optimizations of the algorithm, etc. Therefore, the implementations presented here do not pretend to be used in real tasks.

### Built With

- [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)

<p align="right"><a href="#ClassicML_models">Back to top</a></p>

## Roadmap
There are plans to implement(the list can be updated):
### Linear models
Not implemented yet
### Decision tree
Brief documentation on the implementation is available as docstrings to the functions.

Features:
- MSE and Gini impurity as loss for regression and classification - - respectively
- Avoiding loops wherever possible and vectorizing calculations using numpy.
- Hyperparameters responsible for limiting the maximum depth and minimum number of objects in a node for splitting it as a regularization.
### Random Forest
Not implemented yet
### Gradient boosting
Not implemented yet
